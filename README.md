# CodeAlpha Task - Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Internship.

## Task Details
- Dataset: Car data (Selling Price prediction)
- Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Model: Linear Regression
- Evaluation metrics: RÂ² Score, MSE

## Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. One-hot encoding of categorical variables
3. Splitting data into training & testing sets
4. Model training using Linear Regression
5. Evaluation of model performance
6. Visualization: Actual vs Predicted Car Prices

## Results
- The Linear Regression model is able to predict car prices with reasonable accuracy.
- Metrics are printed at the end of the notebook.

## How to Run
Upload the `car data.csv` file in Google Colab or local Jupyter Notebook and run the `car_price_prediction.ipynb` file.
