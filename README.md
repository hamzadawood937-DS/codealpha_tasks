# Unemployment in India Analysis

## Overview
This is a CodeAlpha Data Science Internship submission analyzing unemployment trends in India.
The notebook performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to understand temporal
and regional patterns of unemployment, including a focused look at the Covid-19 period (2020-2021).

## Files
- `unemployment_analysis.ipynb` : Jupyter / Colab notebook with code and visualizations.
- `Unemployment in India.csv` : Original dataset (place in the same folder before running).
- `cleaned_unemployment_sample.csv` : Example cleaned output generated by the notebook.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
2. Place `Unemployment in India.csv` in the same folder (or upload in Colab).
3. Open and run `unemployment_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab.

## Insights & Next Steps
- Visualize unemployment rate over time and by region.
- Analyze Covid-19 impact (2020â€“2021).
- Possible extensions: feature engineering, regional-level modeling, seasonal decomposition, forecasting with ARIMA or Prophet.
